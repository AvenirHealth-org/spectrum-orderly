## This is a bit of a weird orderly task. I want to run the "run_model" tasks
## on CI, they require access to the PJNZ files. So we've got a couple of
## options for accessing them on the CI runners.
## 1. Sync them with dropbox onto the self-hosted runner
## 2. Download them on demand via rdrop2
## 3. Access them from sharepoint
## 
## Turns out 2. doesn't work outside of an interactive context, rdrop2 doesn't
## have the most up to date auth model and I couldn't get this to work
## well without someone being present to authorise the rdrop2 app in dropbox.
## 1. Is similarly really hard to do without manual intervention
## So we're at 3, so we need a copy of the files on sharepoint. It felt
## easiest to do this by just writing this task to download and push them up
## to the remote. Perhaps it would have been easier to just copy the files
## in bulk. But here we are.

## Note that to run this you will have to have a local copy of the UNAIDS 
## spectrum files from Dropbox. Either from downloading or dropbox sync
## Then run ./scripts/
